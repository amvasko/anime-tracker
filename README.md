🚀 AnimeTracker is a web app for searching, tracking, and managing anime lists. 

🎥 It imports styles, functions, and Axios 📦 for handling requests.
The AnimeTracker class initializes the interface, manages local storage 💾, and sets up event listeners. Users can search 🔍 for anime, add titles ➕ to their list, and retrieve stored entries 📜.

The UI updates dynamically based on user actions, and saved anime remains accessible even after closing the browser. ✅
